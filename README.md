# 🛠️ Mac-A-Park – Smart Parking Detection System

## Overview

Mac-A-Park is a **real-time smart parking detection system** that leverages **existing CCTV cameras** and **computer vision** to detect parking slot occupancy. It provides a **low-cost, scalable solution** for urban areas and large parking facilities, reducing traffic congestion, emissions, and driver frustration.

---

## Problem Statement

In urban areas and large parking facilities, drivers spend significant time searching for available parking spots, which leads to:

- Increased traffic congestion  
- Fuel wastage  
- User frustration  
- Higher carbon emissions  

Most existing solutions rely on **physical sensors for each parking spot**, which are **expensive, difficult to maintain, and impractical at scale**.

## Solution Statement

Mac-A-Park **analyzes CCTV video feeds** using OpenCV and a deep learning object detection model to determine **parking slot occupancy**.  

- Detected availability is updated **in real-time**.  
- Users can **instantly locate free parking spots** via a simple dashboard.  

**Advantages:**  

✅ **Uses Existing Infrastructure** – no additional sensors required  
✅ **Cost-Effective & Scalable** – reduces hardware and maintenance costs  
✅ **Real-Time & Accurate** – slot-based detection reduces errors  
✅ **Hackathon-Friendly & Real-World Ready** – fast prototyping, mirrors real smart city deployments
